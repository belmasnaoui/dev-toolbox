# My Developer Toolbox
This repository includes my basic developer toolbox, with tools and utilities that I take on each of my development environments.

## Visual Studio Utilities
Overtime I intend to bring a collection of utilities to use with Visual Studio for Mac and Windows. The utilities lies on `vs-utils` folder.

* **Snippets for Visual Studio for Mac**: a collection of my own indispensable code snippets that I use daily. Can be easily installed using the `install-snippets.sh` script.
