# My Developer Toolbox
This repository includes my basic developer toolbox, with tools and utilities that I take on each of my development environments.

## Apps and Tools
A list of apps that I use on a daily basis, for both specific and productivity tasks:

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com): replaces entirely the Spotlight with tons of useful new functionalities. Investing on the PowerPack may allow you to replace other tools such as _Paste_ and _TextExpander_, the later with an subscription investment that is expensive since there's almost no more upgrades to the app ever since I started using it. 
* [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com): Brings Window Management shortcuts to macOS, very close to what exists in Windows.
* [Night Owl](https://nightowl.kramser.xyz): Automatically switch between dark and light mode in macOS Mojave.


## Visual Studio Utilities
Overtime I intend to bring a collection of utilities to use with Visual Studio for Mac and Windows. The utilities lies on `vs-utils` folder.

* **Snippets for Visual Studio for Mac**: a collection of my own indispensable code snippets that I use daily. Can be easily installed using the `install-snippets.sh` script.
