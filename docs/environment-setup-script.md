# Environment Setup Script
I found useful to keep a document of the steps to setup a new environment/computer with all the tools and components that I use. Since there are several of them, I always forget to install something or setup some detail of the environment. Keeping my computers ready to do all the things that I need is one of my most productive things.

## Setting Up my macOS Environment
### 1. Install OS
I always install the OS from scratch, I don't like to use images or recover state from backups such as Time Machine.

### 2. Install App Store Apps
The next step is to install the App Store apps that I use. I always start with _Amphetamine_, that I use to keep the computer from sleeping, and then _Xcode_, that take the most time to install.

The present list of App Store software that I use:
* Xcode
* Amphetamine
* Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote)
* OneDrive
* iWork Suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote)
* Yoink
* Pocket
* Kindle
* PixelMator
* TweetBot 3
* MacTracker
* DaisyDisk
* Asset Catalog Creator
* Display Menu
* Evernote
* Disconnect Premium
* Scrivener
* Telegram
* Cocoa JSON Editor
* Helium

### 3. Install Setapp
I'm an old user of Setapp. The platform is very hand and has a good software offerings (even though some important of them has left the platform). The most recent versions of keeps track of the favorite apps and offers to install them automatically when you first open it.

>Also, I remove Setapp icon from the Menubar and remove the keyboard shortcut that clash with other apps.

### 4. Install Other Software
There's a list of the other software that I download directly from the vendors that are either free or I bought out of stores:

* [1Password](https://1password.com/downloads/mac/): my password manager, the first tool that I install.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com): this is what Spotlight should be.
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/downloading): just to keep Alfred settings in sync. Sometimes also need to share something.
* [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): outside Visual Studio specific projects, Code is my text file editor of preference.
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download): my favorite Git client.
* Azure Data Studio
* Azure Storage Explorer
* Postman
* Gorilla Player
* Charles
* Reflection 3
* Parallels Desktop
* Docker

* Spectacle
* Itsycal
* Screenflow
* iMazing
* Node.js
* Python
* Firefox
* Google Chrome
* [Musixmatch](http://about.musixmatch.com/desktop-app): because I like singing. The desktop client works pretty fine.

### 5. Install QuickLook Plugins
[There's a collection of QuickLook Plugins on this site](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) that I found to be really useful and productive, even because they provide access to information that it's hard to get other way. They're mostly useful for programmers and designers.

### 6. Install Fonts
I have some fonts that I use throught the system, either 'cause finding them to be more readable for the workload (such as _Input_ font), either by using them on documents and presentations. The list of the font's I currently install on all of my systems:

* [Input](http://input.fontbureau.com): great for IDE's such as Visual Studio or Xcode.
* [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/): the fonts that Apple have created for newer versions of iOS and macOS to substitute Helvetica. Oddly it's not installed by default.
* [Josefins Sans](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/josefin-sans): I've used this font on some of my presentations and documents.
* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat): I've used this font on some of my presentations and documents.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans): I've used this font on some of my presentations and documents.
* [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto): This is the standard Android font. Sometimes I need to reference it in some of my apps, reason why I need it installed.

### 7. Setup Visual Studio

#### Visual Studio for Mac
Use the vs-utils folder from this repository to add snippets and other settings.

#### Visual Studio Code
Use the Sync Extension to synchronize all the extensions and settings. 

### 8. Setup Bash Environment

### 9. Setup Wallpapers
I keep a folder of my favorite wallpapers to let it roll on my desktop. Seems a dumb concern, but it's good to see some different pictures on the screen that you look the whole day.

### 10. Setup Safari Settings and Extensions
On Safari, there are some important settings for my workflow:

* On the general tab: 
    * Safari opens with: All windows from last session
* On the tabs tab:
    * Show website icons in tabs (very useful for visual identification of the tabs)
* On the Advanced tab:
    * Show developer menu in menu bar - this also allow the `Inspect` right-click menu option.

Also, I use the following extensions (links provided since most of them aren't migrated to App Store as of macOS Mojave):
* [Evernote Web Clipper](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.evernote.safari.clipper-Q79WDW8YH9): Evernote is my knowledge bag and I use the clipper to save pages and links of important references.
* [Save to Pocket](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.ideashower.pocket.safari-ET279A6R5N): I try to reduce the number of open tabs by saving most of them to Pocket.
