# Environment Setup Script
I found useful to keep a document of the steps to setup a new environment/computer with all the tools and components that I use. Since there are several of them, I always forget to install something or setup some detail of the environment. Keeping my computers ready to do all the things that I need is one of my most productive things.

## Setting Up my macOS Environment
### 1. Install OS
I always install the OS from scratch, I don't like to use images or recover state from backups such as Time Machine.

### 2. Install App Store Apps
The next step is to install the App Store apps that I use. I always start with _Amphetamine_, that I use to keep the computer from sleeping, and then _Xcode_, that take the most time to install.

The present list of App Store software that I use:
* Xcode
* Amphetamine
* Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote)
* OneDrive
* iWork Suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote)
* Yoink
* Pocket
* Kindle
* PixelMator
* TweetBot 3
* MacTracker
* DaisyDisk
* Asset Catalog Creator
* Display Menu
* Evernote
* Disconnect Premium
* Scrivener
* Telegram
* Cocoa JSON Editor
* Helium

### 3. Install Setapp
I'm an old user of Setapp. The platform is very hand and has a good software offerings (even though some important of them has left the platform). The most recent versions of keeps track of the favorite apps and offers to install them automatically when you first open it.

>Also, I remove Setapp icon from the Menubar and remove the keyboard shortcut that clash with other apps.

### 5. Install QuickLook Plugins
[There's a collection of QuickLook Plugins on this site](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) that I found to be really useful and productive, even because they provide access to information that it's hard to get other way. They're mostly useful for programmers and designers.

### 6. Install Fonts

Use the vs-utils folder from this repository to add snippets and other settings.
