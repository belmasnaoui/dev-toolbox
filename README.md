# My Developer Toolbox
This repository includes my basic developer toolbox, with tools and utilities that I take on each of my development environments.

## Apps and Tools
A list of apps that I use on a daily basis, for both specific and productivity tasks:

* [**Alfred**](https://www.alfredapp.com): replaces entirely the Spotlight with tons of useful new functionalities. Investing on the PowerPack may allow you to replace other tools such as _Paste_ and _TextExpander_, the later with an subscription investment that is expensive since there's almost no more upgrades to the app ever since I started using it. 
* [**Spectacle**](https://www.spectacleapp.com): Brings Window Management shortcuts to macOS, very close to what exists in Windows.
* [**Night Owl**](https://nightowl.kramser.xyz): Automatically switch between dark and light mode in macOS Mojave.

## Environment
Environment setup and utilities, such as scripts:

* [**base.bash_profile**](environment/base.bash_profile): The basic `.bash_profile` that I use on my environment.

## Microsoft and .NET Development
Tools, utilities, tips and references for Microsoft and .NET development.

### Visual Studio Utilities
Overtime I intend to bring a collection of utilities to use with Visual Studio for Mac and Windows. The utilities lies on `vs-utils` folder.

* **Snippets for Visual Studio Mac (2019)**: a collection of my own indispensable code snippets that I use daily.
* **Key Bindings for Visual Studio Mac (2019)**: the configuration file of the custom key-bindings that I use on Visual Studio.
* **EditorConfig base settings**: the basic `.editorconfig` with code style that I use on my projects.

Snippets and Bindings can be easily installed using the `install.sh` script.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions
Code has a great extensibility and a lot of useful tools.

* [**Settings Sync**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync): Synchronize settings accross development environments using GitHub Gists. Even though it's a lot of manual steps to do the synchronization, it works fine since settings don't change very often. Also very useful when setting up new environments.
* [**REST Client**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client): One of the most impressive extensions that I saw for VS Code. It allows writing HTTP requests from text files, much the same way tou would on `curl`. You can write a sequence of calls and all the sort of testing for HTTP API's.
